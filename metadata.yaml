description: The Light of Asia, subtitled The Great Renunciation, weaves through its
  poetic verses the life and philosophy of Prince Siddhartha Gautama who attained
  enlightenment under the bodhi tree and became the Buddha. Receiving high acclaim
  since its publication in 1879, Edwin Arnold's work was adapted from the Lalitavistara
  Sutra (The Unfolding of the Play.) In the time before this work came out, little
  was known about Buddhism or the Buddha outside of Asia.
